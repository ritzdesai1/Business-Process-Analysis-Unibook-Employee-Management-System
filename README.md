## Unibook Employee Management System
This document outlines the details of the proposed Employee Management System (EMS) called UniBook EMS. The system is intended to enhance the existing processes of employee shift scheduling, task tracking, employee discount verification, on-shift employee tracking, and inventory management for the University Book Center, a retail bookstore located on the campus of the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland, USA. With the implementation of UniBook EMS, the University Book Center expects to see significant improvements in employee productivity, customer service, and overall store operations.
